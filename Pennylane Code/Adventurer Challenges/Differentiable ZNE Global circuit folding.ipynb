    "In the \"Explorer\" level challenge, you looked at modelling noise in a quantum computer. Let's take an adventure into the realm of error-mitigation with the introduction of global circuit folding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error mitigation is the idea that we can bypass, or mitigate, errors that are present in real quantum hardware without actually doing anything to the hardware itself. Remember those bitflip errors you looked at? What if there was a way to get rid of them without actually getting rid of them?\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we do this in practice? With zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The ZNE protocol approaches error mitigation in a somewhat backwards way; instead of coming up with a way to reduce the error directly, we instead increase the error and extrapolate back to zero error. In other words, we want to create more noise in order to extrapolate less noise. So how do we create more noise?\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to create more noise in a quantum circuit being run on real hardware is to increase the depth of the quantum circuit. Imagine I have some unitary $U$ that describes my quantum circuit. I still want my circuit to effectively be described by $U$, but what's to stop us from doing this: $U\\to U\\mathbb{I}^n = U(U^{\\dag}U)^n$? At the end of the day, the circuit is still doing the same thing, but we've increased the number of gates in the circuit $d$ to be $d\\to d(2n+1)$. If programming each gate onto a real device imparts some noise, we've introduced more noise from this mapping!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize the mapping $U\\to U(U^{\\dag}U)^n$ further by including partial folds: $$U\\to U(U^{\\dag}U)^n\\to U\\to U(U^{\\dag}U)^n L_d^{\\dag}\\dots L_s^{\\dag}L_s\\dots L_d$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $s\\in[1, d]$ and $L_i$ denotes a quantum gate within $U$. Specifically, $U=L_1L_2\\dots L_s\\dots L_d$. In this challenge, you will implement a noisy circuit $U\\to U(U^{\\dag}U)^n\\to U\\to U(U^{\\dag}U)^n L_d^{\\dag}\\dots L_s^{\\dag}L_s\\dots L_d$."
