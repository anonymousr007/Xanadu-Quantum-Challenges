    "# Fourier spectrum of quantum models - Distance in Fourier space\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum models can be used to approximate real functions that take in one (or even several) real variables. But how good is this approximation? One way to measure the closeness of the approximate to the analytic function is by calculating the $\\mathcal{l}^2$ distance in Fourier space, which we will define later. For the purposes of this challenge, we are interested in approximating a function $\\mathbb{f}:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$  with discrete Fourier expansion $$f(x) = \\sum_{\\omega=-3}^{\\omega=3}c_\\omega e^{i\\omega x}$$\n",
    "where the $c_\\omega$ are complex numbers knows as Fourier coefficients. We see that the function can be decomposed into sinusoidal waves of frequencies 0, 1, 2 or 3. An interesting result in quantum machine learning is that we can get such functions by using a model with an _in-parallel encoding block_ containing three $\\mathbf{RX}$ gates, one in each wire, as shown below:"
