    "# Differentiable ZNE: Noisy circuits\n",
    "Whenever we simulate quantum circuits, we can do so under the most ideal circumstances, i.e. without needing to worry about noise. In practice, implementing, say, a Pauli $\\mathbf{Z}$ gate on today's hardware isn't as easy as writing `qml.PauliZ`; what ends up actually being implemented is an operation that's close to `qml.PauliZ` because, in some way, real-world noise is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to combat noise, including a technique called zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE). We will work more with ZNE later! But, on the path towards fault-tolerant quantum computing, we must inevitably understand noise in order to combat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "PennyLane offers the ability to simulate different types of noise that are present in quantum devices. One such type of noise is called a _bitflip error_. A bitflip error, occuring with a probability $p$ on a given single qubit, is an error resulting in the state of a qubit being accidentally flipped. Check out this demo to learn more about modelling noise in PennyLane!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you'll implement a two-qubit circuit that contains bitflip errors on each of the qubits to see how the resulting quantum state drifts from that of the noise-less/error-free circuit. To do so, the fidelity between the respective states for various bitflip probabilities $p$ will be calculated."

    "If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's a `1e-4` relative error tolerance), the output will be `\"Correct!\"`. Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt."
