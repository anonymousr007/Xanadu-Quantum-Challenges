    "# Quantum transforms and noise: Energy dissipation\n",
    "When we program quantum devices in PennyLane, we assume that gates work exactly as expected. This assumption is not entirely true. Gates are noisy: our qubit interacts with the quantum state of its surroundings and its state may change! For example, a qubit could dissipate energy into the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us study a toy model of such a process. We model energy dissipation by gates in a **one-qubit circuit** by adding the following interaction with the environment **after every gate**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/dqt_circuit2.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the following one-qubit `circuit` with rotation parameter $\\alpha$,\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/dqt_circuit1.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "your task is to create and apply the quantum transform `noise`, which depends on the noise parameter $\\beta$, in order to add energy dissipation after each gate in `circuit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final objective is to **find the purity** $P=Tr(\\rho^2)$ of the final state $\\rho$ of the one-qubit system. The purity is a measure of how noisy our final state is. If it's close to 1, it means that the state was not affected by external noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge code\n",
    "You must complete the `state_purity` function to find the purity of the final state of the one-qubit system after dissipating energy. The system's initial state $\\ket{\\psi}$ is parametrized by a rotation _angle_ $\\theta$ and a _phase_ $\\phi$:\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\psi} = cos(\\frac{\\theta}{2})\\ket{0} + e^{i\\phi}sin(\\frac{\\theta}{2})\\ket{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to solve this probem is to use `qml.transforms.insert` to apply your `noise` transformation to circuit to create the `noisy_circuit` QNode.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Do not use `transforms` as decorators for this problem. They will yield different results due to how they work on the back-end. Use them within circuits instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that the preparation of the initial state _does not_ dissipate energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "As input to this problem, you are given:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `angle` (`float`): The angle $\\theta$ parametrizing the initial state\n",
    "* `phase` (`float`): The phase angle $\\phi$ parametrizing the initial state\n",
    "* `circuit_param` (`float`): The rotation angle $\\alpha$ in the $\\mathbf{RX}$ gate in the `circuit` we add noise to.\n",
    "* `noise_param` (`float`): The rotation angle in the $\\beta$ in the $\\mathbf{CRX}$ gate in our model for energy dissipation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "This code will output a `float` corresponding to the purity of the final state of the one-qubit system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your solution matches the correct one within the given tolerance specified in `check` (in this case it's an absolute tolerance of `0.01`), the output will be `\"Correct!\"`. Otherwise, you will receive a `\"Wrong answer\"` prompt."
